# NestJS Clean Architecture Project

## Description

This is a base project that implements the main concepts of clean architecture in a [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) application. [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is a software development approach that promotes separation of responsibilities and organization of code in a clear and concise way.

It is a project management system. Contains the basic functionalities for creating and managing projects.

## Resources
- Organized directory structure to facilitate project maintenance and scalability.
- Use of NestJS modules to divide code into reusable components.
